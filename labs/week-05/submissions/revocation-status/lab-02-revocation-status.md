## Results
- What OCSP URL did you find in the certificate's Authority Information Access extension?
-   URI:http://ocsp.sectigo.com

- What was the OCSP response status (`good`, `revoked`, or `unknown`) and what does it mean?
-   Didn't show
- What were the `This Update` and `Next Update` values in the OCSP response, and what do they indicate?
- Where was the CRL Distribution Point located in the certificate?

## Key Findings

## Explanation
- What is the difference between OCSP and CRL as revocation checking methods?
- Why does an OCSP query require both the leaf certificate and the issuer certificate?
- In what scenario would a certificate show `unknown` status from an OCSP responder?

## Challenges / Troubleshooting

## Artifacts
- leaf_cert.pem, issuer_cert.pem, ocsp_response.txt
